-=Goal=-
Format texts from The Latin Library in a way that can be printed and bound into dwarsligger-style texs.

-=Requirements=-
- Take as input a list of .shtml files (eg the twelve pages for the twelve books of the Aeneid)
- Strip out line numbers (in poetry)
- Respect <p> and <br> breaks
- Different .shtml files should have an enforced page break between them
- Also enforce page breaks between clearly-marked ""sections"" of a longer page (eg individual poems of Catullus or Martial)
- Two-column format where possible 
	- If two "sections" could fit side-by-side on one page (again, many of Martial's poems would likely do this), do so
	- Similarly, if the font size allows two columns of dactylic hexameter to fit on a page, do so
- Ability to specify a "cover image"
- User can specify margins, page height, and font size. Default to 8.5" x 8.5" square.

- Consecutive pages A, B, C, E should come out looking like

-------  -------
|  B  |	 | ∀  |
|-----|	 |-----|
|  C  |	 | Ǝ   |
------	 -------

ToDo: Enforce line breaks for prose at page end ("rounded down" to the nearest word)
ToDo: solid line for folding on SideBSideC side
ToDo: Combine bitmaps into a printable PDF

-=Nice to have=-
The "next level" would be to format PDFs like this.
Probably print four pages per side, so each half-side has two pages side-by-side.
